TrakMyRun is a social media and fitness tracking platform that allows users to map their runs, save them, and share them with others.
By using the directions service, polylines, and intercepting user clicks, I was able to draw routes between clicks that snap to roads
and sidewalks. I also included save and load features by storing coordinates in a text format and writing a custom method to parse 
the text into Gmap LatLng objects.
